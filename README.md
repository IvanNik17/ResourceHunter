# ResourceHunter
A short android game prototype, made part of a game jam with the theme of **resources**



# Game Explanation
●	Resource gathering hover vehicle game.
●	Select map size and the number of each of the three resources that need to be gathered:
  ○	Wood cells - harvested by shooting at trees and picking up fallen cells
  ○	Solar cells - harvested by jumping from ramps and grabbing them
  ○	Water cells - harvested by stopping above pools of water and waiting until cells are drawn
●	Cells are put into the cargo of the vehicle - cargo has 12 slots and once full they need to be unloaded into the docking area.
●	Each time the game is started it randomizes the position of pools of water, ramps, docking area and trees. Trees are created randomly and procedurally from subparts
●	Once the game starts the timer starts counting. Gather the resources as fast as possible and unload them into the dock.
●	Once the resources are gathered the game ends and a score of the time is given to the player.
●	Steering the vehicle is done with the accelerometer of the phone
●	Forward and backward trust are given by tapping on the top and bottom left side of the screen
●	Shooting is done by tapping on the right bottom side of the screen
●	Game consists of 4 screens.
●	Tested on Windows, Editor and OnePlus 3T phone.
